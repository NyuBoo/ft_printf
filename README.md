# Compiler.sh
I have created a compile.sh for you to make your tests in a faster way

# Uses
- Does 'make'.
- Compiles (with flags) your function adding everything that is necessary and the main function.
- Call the generated ./a.out and print the results.

# Careful
In case your main is inside your ft_printf.c, you should remove it from the script.
